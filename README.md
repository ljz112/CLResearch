# CLResearch
Code for independent research project on computational linguistics in music (also for my Senior Thesis).

Specifically, I'm focusing on linguistic borrowing in European rap songs, comparing how it occurs between different countries.

For my thesis, all the python files relavant to the project are marked as so. Additionally, contact me if you need any access codes to the API -- they are stored locally and not on the repository.
